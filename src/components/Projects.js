                                I was perusing the internet one day when I noticed that the domain with my name was
                                available. I had never done any sort of web design with javascript or react but was
                                eager to tackle the challange and do something interesting with the domain. After
                                brianstorming for a bit, I settled on creating a web resume. It would provide me with
                                a space to show off some of my projects and interests. But it would also provide a challange
                                as a multi-page website. Since starting I have learned tons about web design, JavaScript,
                                React and Material UI. I have found it extrmemely satisfying to build this project from my
                                imagination. If you have any feedback or suggetions, feel free to leave them by selecting

                                The Harry Potter series has always been one of my favorite book series of all time. And so,
                                I wanted to see how the linguistic sentiment changes over the coures of the books. To do this
                                I wrote a simple app using RStudio's Shiny. Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build
                                interactive web apps straight from R. For this project I used the well known R packages of the
                                Tidyverse to plot the data. In order to analyze the sentiment of these books I used the sentiment
                                lexicons of AFINN and Bing et al. To explore the results head over to the github repo to view the
                                code or visit the shinyapp.io hosted web app directly.

                                Using Clojure, a Lisp language on the JVM, I created a command line tool for querying files. While normally
                                compiled on the JVM and run as a .jar file, Babashka is a Clojure interpreter that allows for much faster
                                startup as an alternative for Clojure scripting compared to slugish JVM Clojure. In order to acheive this,
                                increased startup speed, it sacrafices a general performance as compaired to executing compiled Clojure code.
                                Another safrafice Babaska makes is that the sci interpreter is only compatable a "substantial subset of Clojure."
                                If you are interested I would encorange you to check out the link to Babaska's git page below. Below I have also
                                included a sample usage of babashka-search.
